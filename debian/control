Description: Data logger for the smart storage experiment.
 The smart storage logger is a program developed to collect data
 about a user's activities.  It monitors and records the files that a
 user accesses, used and available network connections, battery status
 and programs that are run.  This data is then upload to
 hssl.cs.jhu.edu.
 .
 This data is being used by the HSSL researchers in understanding how
 users use data and their devices in general with the primary goal of
 designing an algorithm to determining which files have the least
 utility and thus are the best candidates for deletion.  Secondary
 goals include the design of an API to allow applications to register
 files that can be deleted automatically, designing an API to inform
 applications of storage pressure to allow them to take action, and
 designing a user interface to allow users to designate groups of
 files that can be deleted automatically.  This will help users by
 simplifying storage management and enable applications to more
 aggressively prefetch and cache data as disrupting the user or other
 applications is no longer an issue.
